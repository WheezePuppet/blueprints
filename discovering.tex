\chapter{Discovering the design}

This chapter marks a watershed of sorts. Up to this point, we've been doing
\textbf{analysis} instead of \textbf{synthesis}. Analysis is when you look at
something that already exists -- a design diagram or a code snippet, say --
and seek to understand it, usually by breaking it down into its constituent
parts. Synthesis, on the other hand, is designing something that doesn't
already exist. Instead of scrutinizing a UML diagram, we're creating a UML
diagram; instead of examining a method, we're writing a method.
